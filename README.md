 ## Description

SPAMACHINE is a Java client application designed to send prank emails to groups of victims. It uses a fake SMTP server (MailDev) to simulate email sending to victims and prank messages are loaded from input files.


## Setup the lab environment

First init the docker compose file

[MailDev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev) is a fake SMTP server for testing emails. Pull its Docker image using:

```bash
docker pull maildev/maildev:latest
```

Init the docker compose file

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You can build the project with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) using the pom.xml file
```bash
mvn -f Client/pom.xml clean package
```

You can run the SPAMACHINE with the following command:

```bash
java -jar Client/target/Client-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <victimFile> <messageFile> <groupCount>
```

---

## Input File Structures and Validation

To run the SPAMACHINE correctly, you need two input files:

- A victim email file (.txt)
- A prank message file (.txt)

These files must follow specific formats to ensure the program processes them correctly.

### 1. Victim Email File (victims.txt)

The victim file contains a list of email addresses, with each email address on a separate line.

#### Requirements:
- Only valid email addresses are accepted (validated with regex).
- Invalid or improperly formatted email addresses will be ignored.
- Can have blank lines between

#### Example Structure:
```bash
john.doe@example.com 
jane_doe123@domain.org 

user@sub.domain.co.uk 
admin@company.io 
contact@service.com
```

### 2. Prank Message File (messages.txt)

The message file contains the messages to be sent as emails. 

#### Requirements:
- Email subject and body must be on the same line.
- Can have blank lines between

#### Example Structure:

## Implementation

The program is divided into several modules, each responsible for specific tasks:

### Main
- Entry point of the program.
- Reads input files, processes arguments and initializes the email-sending process.

### MailHandler
- Manages communication with the SMTP server.
- Sends commands and reads responses from the server.

### MailWorker
- Handles SMTP protocol logic.
- Ensures proper sequencing of commands like EHLO, MAIL, RCPT, etc.

### Mail
- Represents an email with sender, recipients, and message content.

### Enums SmtpCommand and SmtpStatus
- Define the commands and expected server responses for the SMTP protocol.

## How It Works

### Reading Input
- Victim emails and prank messages are read from files and validated.
- Victims are grouped based on the specified number of groups.

### SMTP Communication
- The program connects to the MailDev SMTP server (via localhost:1025).
- Commands are sent sequentially (EHLO, MAIL, RCPT, DATA, etc.) to send each prank email.

### Error Handling
- If an unexpected server response is received, the program attempts to exit with a QUIT command.


## Program Output

### Program Demo Output
![Diagramme des classes](./Client/Rendu/demo-screenshot.png)

In the screenshot above, the program sends prank emails to 5 groups of victims. We choosed to have groups of 2 victims but as we only have 9 victims, the last group has only one victim (handled by the program). The program sends a prank email to each victim, with the sender displayed being a random victim from the entire list.

### MailDev Web Interface Output
![Diagramme des classes](./Client/Rendu/maildev-demo-screenshot.png)

In the screenshot above, the MailDev web interface shows the prank emails received by the victims. Each email is displayed with the sender, recipient, and message content. The email content is a random prank message from the input file.

### Empty File Handling

In the screenshot above, the program handles an empty victim file by displaying an error message and exiting.
